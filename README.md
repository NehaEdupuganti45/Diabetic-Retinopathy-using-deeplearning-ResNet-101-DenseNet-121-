Diabetes sickness upsurges the quantity of glucose in the blood triggered by a deficiency of insulin. Diabetes affects retina, heart, nerves and kidney. One important complication is Diabetic Retinopathy. The mechanized methods for Diabetic Retinopathy recognition are flexible for cost and time reduction and are more competent over manual analysis. Deep Learning technique performs computer aided medical diagnosis. This project is an attempt toward finding an automatic solution for Diabetic Retinopathy disease in initial stage. Using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, doctors can find blindness before it happens. In this project we are going to use supervised learning approach to perform classification on fundus images. For this project we are going to employ several image processing procedures and filters to improve many significant features like microaneurysm, hemorrhages, exudates, swollen blood vessels which are the features of fundus image that imply that particular person has Diabetic Retinopathy and then using neural networks for classification.
